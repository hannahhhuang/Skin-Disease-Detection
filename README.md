# Skin-Disease-Detection
We decided to use the Skin Diseases Image Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailpromus/skin-diseases-image-dataset) and perform a Multi-Class Classification Problem.
Our vision is to create a Web Platform for users to upload or take a picture of some part of their body has visible skin disease symptoms and have our Machine Learning Model 
classify what type of skin disease this user might have. Afterwards, our pipeline would recommend a specific treatment plan to the user to ensure the user is getting the treatment needed. We have created multiples to test and experiment which Machine Learning Techniques were best suited for handling our specific
tasks. Specifically, we tested many different configurations for Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's), [Inception V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385v1),
and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993). 

# Project Setup
You can see our we have two folders: Skin Disease Detection Website and Skin-Disease-Dection-Models. The Skin Disease Dection Website folder contains all the code for a 
prototype web platform allowing users to interact and receive predictions and medical recommendations based on classified skin diseases.

The Skin-Disease-Dection-Models folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks of Python Code detailing our Data Exploration/Science Process and Machine Learning Training and Experimentation
process.
