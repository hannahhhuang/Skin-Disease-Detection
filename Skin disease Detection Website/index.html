    <img src="mpic.png" style="width:50%">
    <p id="description" class="de">Melanocytic nevi are common benign (non-cancerous) skin growths that contain pigment-producing cells (melanocytes). They are sometimes called 'moles' Most moles are small (less than a quarter of an inch in diameter) and dark brown, but some moles can be larger, raised, and flesh-colored. The vast majority of melanocytic nevi are harmless, but it's important to keep an eye on any changes in size, shape, or color, as these can be signs of melanoma, a potentially dangerous skin cancer. </p>
    <h3 id="treatment" class="de">Our advice is that if you have a mole that changes, itches, bleeds, or appears unusual in any way, you should see a doctor for evaluation.</h3>
