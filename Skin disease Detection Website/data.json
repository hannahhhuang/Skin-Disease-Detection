      "disease": "Melanocytic Nevi (NV)",
      "description": "Melanocytic nevi are common benign (non-cancerous) skin growths that contain pigment-producing cells (melanocytes). They are sometimes called 'moles' Most moles are small (less than a quarter of an inch in diameter) and dark brown, but some moles can be larger, raised, and flesh-colored. The vast majority of melanocytic nevi are harmless, but it's important to keep an eye on any changes in size, shape, or color, as these can be signs of melanoma, a potentially dangerous skin cancer. ",
      "treatment": "Our advice is that if you have a mole that changes, itches, bleeds, or appears unusual in any way, you should see a doctor for evaluation."
